I’m **Fabrizio De Castelli**, a Master's student in **Artificial Intelligence** at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/), with a strong interest in machine learning, geometric deep learning, and algorithmic problem solving.

I earned my **BSc in Computer Science** with *Highest Honours* from the University of Pisa in 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I built a strong foundation in algorithms, optimization, and discrete mathematics — skills that now inform my current research and academic direction.

In 2022–2023, I was awarded the **SEMP Merit Scholarship**, which allowed me to study at the [Università della Svizzera italiana (USI)](https://www.usi.ch/en) in Lugano, Switzerland. There, I worked with a diverse academic community and deepened my theoretical background in machine learning and data science.

My current research focuses on **long-range spatiotemporal propagation in Discrete-Time Dynamic Graphs (D-TDGs)**, with applications in temporal reasoning over graph-structured data. I’m particularly interested in modeling temporal dependencies in dynamic systems using geometric and probabilistic methods.

My broader interests include:

- **Deep learning** (especially geometric and probabilistic models)
- **Computer vision**
- **Competitive programming**
- **Graph representation learning**

Outside of academia, I enjoy playing guitar, endurance sports, and spending time by the sea.
